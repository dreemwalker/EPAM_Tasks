War, the very first war of our world
When the treacherous witch was killed
Three times burned and three times born
By searing flames was Gullveig torn

Death, Odin hurled his spear off with great force
Deep into the great vana-fyrd
Battle horns gave up their sound
And Asgard walls razed to the ground
